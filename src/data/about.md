# Intro

I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

I have been actively looking for work. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to develop my skills in Application Development and Project Management further, like I was doing in my previous role. Learning New Technologies like [Android Native](https://developer.android.com/studio), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Internet Of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), and newbie to [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
